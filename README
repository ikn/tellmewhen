    DEPENDENCIES

Python 3 (>= 3.3): https://www.python.org

    INSTALLATION

There is no installation method on Windows.  On Unix-like OSs, with Python 3,
bash, sed, find and make, run

    ./configure
    make
    make install

The makefile respects the `prefix', `DESTDIR', etc. arguments.  Of course,
`make install' needs to be run as root if installing outside of your home
directory.  To uninstall, run

    make uninstall

`make clean' and `make distclean' are also supported, and work as expected.

    CONFIGURATION

The server is configured with a JSON configuration file.  An example can be
found in config.sample.json.  The structure is an object containing an 'events'
property which is an array of objects.  Each event object represents a timer
that may execute a command periodically when running, and has the following
properties:

* name: the name of the event
* command: array of command followed by arguments to execute when triggering the
           event
* separation_time: time between occurrences of this event, in seconds
* triggers: array of objects indicating times relative to each event occurrence
            at which the command should be executed, each with the following
            properties:
    * offset_time: the time relative to the event occurrence at which to execute
                   the command, in seconds (may (and usually will) be negative)

An example configuration file can be found in `config.sample.json'.

    USAGE

Start the server, `tellmewhend', then run commands using `tellmewhenc'.  For
invocation details, pass an argument `--help' to either program.  Available
commands are documented as part of `tellmewhenc'.

On Windows, in the source directory, run

    python tellmewhend
    python tellmewhenc ...

where `python' is the Python 3 interpreter.

On Unix-like OSs, once installed, run

    tellmewhend
    tellmewhenc ...

(installed to /usr/local/bin/ by default).  Alternatively, you can run in-place
without installing by

    ./tellmewhend
    ./tellmewhenc ...

For example, run a program which sets up keyboard shortcuts to start events, and
have the command for each play a different sound.
